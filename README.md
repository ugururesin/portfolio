# Portfolio by Ugur Uresin
Data Science Professional  
PhD in the field of Digital Twin   

Welcome to my portfolio repository! This is where I showcase my projects and skills as a developer and engineer.

## About Me

I am an engineer with almost **10 years of experience** in both numerical simulation and machine learning. In the first 5 years of my career, I studied and worked on **numerical simulation, finite element analysis, and data analysis**. In the last 5 years, I have been studying and working on **machine learning, deep learning, big data, industry 4.0, digital twins, and software development** in Turkey's largest Automotive company.
